# MOFit: A Framework to reduce Obesity using Machine learning and IoT

From the past few years, due to advancements in
technologies, the sedentary living style in urban areas is at its
peak. This results in individuals getting a victim of obesity at
an early age. There are various health impacts of obesity like
Diabetes, Heart disease, Blood pressure problems, and many
more. Machine learning from the past few years is showing its
implications in all expertise like forecasting, healthcare, medical
imaging, sentiment analysis, etc. In this work, we aim to provide
a framework that uses machine learning algorithms namely,
Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, Extra Trees, and KNN
to train models that would help predict obesity levels (Classification), Bodyweight, and fat percentage levels (Regression)
using various parameters. We also applied and compared various
hyperparameter optimization (HPO) algorithms such as Genetic
algorithm, Random Search, Grid Search, Optuna to further
improve the accuracy of the models. The website framework
contains various other features like making customizable Diet
plans, workout plans, and a dashboard to track the progress.
The framework is built using the Python Flask. Furthermore, a
weighing scale using the Internet of Things (IoT) is also integrated into the framework to track calories and macronutrients
from food intake
